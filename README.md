# wallpaper-from-top

Simple scripts to set your linux wallpaper to the wordcloud image of the current running processes.

## Current Limitations
* Automatically sets wallpaper only in KDE Plasma
* Uses only raw memory consumption stats to sort the processes
* Does not change wallpaper automatically

## To Do
* Use better resource stats to sort processes
* Support Gnome to set up wallpaper automatically
* Update wallpaper automatically (Do not know how to do it yet!)
* Use config file to set wallpaper resolution and other properties
* Mask wordcloud to the most resource heavy process (Do not know how to do it either)
